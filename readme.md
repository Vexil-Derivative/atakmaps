ATAK Map Projects
-----------------

This repo holds various ATAK-related map projects and may drift over time as different data/maps are used. Each project lives in its own folder under `projects/`.

Projects
- USFS MVUM — Motor Vehicle Use Map export to ATAK KML/KMZ (roads/trails, labels, access legend). Requires MVUM roads/trails shapefiles placed in `projects/mvum/inputs/` (not tracked in git); see `projects/mvum/readme.md` for details.


#Links
This PDF has been invaluable for information on ATAK KML styling, no one else seems to have covered this information, at this level of detail. This is also included in the `/docs` folder, just to ensure it's not lost.
